Animation
=========

Godot features many ways to animate game content. The first way is through the
AnimationPlayer node, you can read more about this here:
`Introduction to the 2D animation features`_.

Sometimes, animations need to be blended, or mixed together. This is more
commonly used with 3D animation where a character needs to do multiple things
at the same time, e.g. walk and shoot. You can read more about it here:
`AnimationTree`_.

Godot also supports `Cutout animation`_ and `2D skeletons`_.
