Welcome to Godot for Designers's documentation!
===============================================

The purpose of this document series is to teach level designers, artists,
writers, etc. how to use the Godot game engine with little programming
experience. Every game, of course, must have some form of code to function;
however, game developers tend to work in teams and delegate different tasks to
different members. Although it does help to have some programming experience,
there are many tasks that can be performed in the Godot game engine without
needing to touch any code.

One of the most important resources for learning how to use the Godot game
engine is the `Godot Official Documentation`_, which will be referenced
several times throughout this text. There are some things that it describes
much better than I can, and it's a very useful resource for learning the engine
anyways.
